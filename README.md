## Intention
This is intended as a base for all spherical object render and manipulation in html.
This has a feature with sections >> Scrolling on them automatically triggers them to start fading in using JavaScript and CSS.
## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run these commands in IDE or bash/CMD:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
# This uses WEBPACK
npm run dev


# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
Then you're ready to modify as needed!
