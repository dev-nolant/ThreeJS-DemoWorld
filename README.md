# Three.js Floating Earth Website
Earth Textures Courtesy of James Hastings-Trew @ http://planetpixelemporium.com/earth.html
## Intention
This is intended as a base for all spherical object render and manipulation in html.
This has a feature with sections >> Scrolling on them automatically triggers them to start fading in using JavaScript and CSS.
## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run these commands in IDE or bash/CMD:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
git clone https://github.com/dev-nolant/ThreeJS-DemoWorld.git
 
npm install 

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
# This uses WEBPACK
npm run dev


# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
Then you're ready to modify as needed!
# Note
Three.JS can be uploaded to a webhost through the converting of the bundler to a static variable. This project's static conversion can be found: [here](https://github.com/dev-nolant/ThreeJS-DemoWorld/tree/main/Single_File)
